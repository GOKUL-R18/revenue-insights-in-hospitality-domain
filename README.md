## Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide these insights.

Their revenue management team had hired a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Key Metrics Definitions

Occupancy Rate: Measure the percentage of rooms occupied over a given period.
occupancy_rate = (occupied_rooms / total_rooms) * 100

Average Daily Rate (ADR): Calculate the average revenue earned per occupied room.
adr = total_revenue / occupied_rooms

Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): Assess the total revenue generated per available room.
revpar = total_revenue / total_rooms

Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): Collect feedback and gauge customer satisfaction.
csat = (satisfied_customers / total_customers) * 100

Occupancy %: Total successful bookings relative to the total room capacity.
occupancy_percentage = (successful_bookings / total_capacity) * 100

Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN): Average number of rooms booked per day over a time period.
dbrn = total_booked_rooms / total_days

Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN): Average number of rooms available for sale per day.
dsrn = total_sellable_rooms / total_days
